<div id="Question">
<div class="thinnerSpace"></div>
How are decisions about the operation of society made? <br>
What governs the quantities & qualities of production, or the social programs & laws that exist?
<div class="thinnerSpace"></div>
</div>

<div class="mainw" >
<div class="thinnestSpace"></div>
Decisions are <i>not</i> made based upon the needs of all.
Some are excluded. Often many. Those that can't pay, don't get. Food that could feed the starving is regularly destroyed, or not even grown. Houses lie empty, or aren't ever built, because the poor are not a market.
Profit, not people, determines the why, what, when & where of production.

It's Production for Sale at a Profit : Can't Pay? - Go Away!

<div class="thinnestSpace"></div>
A relentless, un-stoppable competitive chase for profits is destroying the ecology of the world. No matter, it seems, given the lack of governmental response, that this may then wipe out the human race.  Poor quality goods are produced, not because people want to make, or have, junk, but because there's more profit in it.

Everyone can think of examples of how decision-making puts profits before needs.

Their interests enslave the rest of us. Society dances to their tune.
Governments act to maintain and maximise profits for the owners as a <i>group</i>. We'll all tighten our belts, once again, for 'the Nation'.   
Sometimes one owner or group of owners may go 'bust', but overall, as a 'Class' they are  are <i>always</i> winning. 
<div class="thinnestSpace"></div>
</div>
<div class="bottom-line"><div class="thinnestSpace"></div>
Their profits <i>always</i> come first, regardless of anyone's pain.

<div class="thinnestSpace"></div>
Centuries of hard work and technological advances have greatly increased our productive capabilities. Yet production itself always comes in fits and starts. It's 'all hands to the pump', then it's 'no work here, today'. All we ever get is 'Boom' - then 'Bust', then ? All too often, any hard-won  gains are swiftly ghosted away. They'll call it 'making economies'. As ever, we'll be the 'sacrifice'...

Decisions are <u>not</u> made in the majority workers' interest.

<div class="thinnestSpace"></div>
No-one has ever, or will ever, enjoy <i>security</i> as a 'wage-slave'.
Disaster is only ever a job-loss or shut-down or illness away.
And the gap between the very rich and the rest of us widens ever faster, every day.
