It is highly unlikely that the capitalist class will ever <i>voluntarily</i> give up its privileged position in society. 
Governments <i>exist</i> solely to administer society as it <i>is</i>, i.e. in the interests of the ruling (capitalist) class: so governments won't end the privilege.
Capitalism will continue while the working class accepts it.

It is dangerous and futile to follow those who support violence by minorities of workers against the armed force of the state.
Violent revolution has sometimes meant different faces in the capitalist class or it's governments.
It has <i>always</i> meant <u>dead</u> workers, and never has or could result in the liberation of the working class.
Unless a <i>majority</i> of workers organize <b>consciously</b> and <b>politically</b> to take <u>control</u> of the state machinery, including its armed forces, the  state will always win.

Political democracy is the greatest tool (next to its labour-power) that the working class has at its disposal. When the <b><i>majority</i></b> of workers support Socialism, so-called "revolutionary" war will not be required. There will be a majority of Socialists in most institutions. 

A <i>real</i> revolution needs workers to stop following leaders, to understand why society functions as it does, and to then think and act for themselves.
Delegates will be sent to the democratic institutions to abolish Capital and it's State : where suitable institutions do not yet exist they will be created.
Socialism will be the result of workers democratically choosing and instituting a new, cooperative, classless society based upon the satisfaction of human needs.

Capitalism is <b>never</b> a democratic society. Many countries run as dictatorships, and in many others, the vote is restricted to trusted sections of the population.
 Where that vote <i>is</i> granted, once every few years, it picks just one politician from only a few candidates to 'represent' - not just you - but an entire area or town! Even if their hands weren't in fact tied to the needs of Capital for Profit, that's not much choice! 
Socialism will be the world's <i>first</i> truly democratic society. All that choose will be able to have their say in all that's to be done, or not to be done, at any time.
