The working class is by now the vast majority of the population of the world. It already organises and runs all of society. Yet it nowhere does so in it's own interest. The capitalist class still holds the purse strings and calls all the tunes. 

The working class is a young, and, as yet, immature class. Most of it's members do not know that they are wage-slaved in the interest of another class. Nor that production directly for use with free access for all - Socialism - is an immediately practical alternative. to wages and and other prices.      
 Socialists work to build a conscious majority for Socialism amongst the Working Class.

Capitalism can only be replaced when this majority at last acts for itself, for Socialism.

The Socialist Party has an absolute need of supporters with understanding and self-reliance. 
 Why are we still blinded by the light of 'their' gold? Surely, gold only shines by reflected light...

A conscious majority is a necessary condition for Socialism.

Capital is the last remaining chain on working class endeavours. Our efforts mould the world with it, but we do not control it. We cannot conceive of a leader-ridden working class ever succeeding in displacing the capitalist class from power.  
Still less, such an <i>immature</i> class successfully undertaking the responsibilities of <i><b>democratic</b></i> socialist society. 
The Socialist Party seeks, not power, but it's <i><b>abolition</b></i>.
Working class emancipation necessarily <i>excludes</i> the role of political leadership.
This sets the Socialist Party apart from <u>all</u> other political parties.

A conscious majority is a sufficient condition for Socialism.
