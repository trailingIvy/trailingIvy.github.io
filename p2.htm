Often, many mere <i>differences</i> in society are taken, falsely, and dangerously, as important <i>divisions</i>.
Differences of sex, skin colour, national origin, religion or the amount of money that a person makes, amongst many others, certainly exist. Isn't it just lazy-thinking that leads people  to take 'sides' on these grounds when troubles strike? Just all to easy to blame it all on the 'other lot', or the 'other side'? To mistake causes for effects? In reality, it's almost always the inevitable <i>insecurities</i> of Capitalism itself that <i>causes</i> the troubles.

There is a more <i>relevant</i> and useful division of society. A division based upon a persons's way of acquiring wealth. If you must at least <i>try</i> to gain employment to obtain a living then you are 'Working Class'. 
Almost all of us must make our incomes, lower or higher, as wages or salaries earned from our jobs. The more we earn, the more we seem to need to spend. The working class earns it's <i>subsistence</i>. We're always 'broke', so it's back to work in the morning - again.
Many workers today may own a few shares, or have some savings. Rarely will any have enough to quit their work permanently to live off their savings and investments.

Today, virtually all of the world's ' <a href="p2.htm" onClick="window.open('means.htm', 'system', 'toolbar=0,menubar=0,scrollbars=0,height=195,width=880,top=148,left=200')">means of living</a> '
 - it's land, factories, etc., -  have been taken into private or <a href="p2.htm" onClick="window.open('state.htm', 'state', 'toolbar=0,menubar=0,scrollbars=0,height=178,width=860,top=155,left=200')"> state ownership</a>.

Those very few whose ownership '<i>share</i>' enables them to live off their investments without ever actually <i>needing</i> to work are the 'Capitalist Class'.
Capitalists live, usually richly, off their investments by the taking of <span class="red">Rent</span>, <span class="green">Interest</span> and <span class="blue">Profit</span>. This is accrued from the <i>un-paid</i> part of the labour of the working class.

There certainly exists a <b>Class Division</b> between workers and owners. It clearly matters. In it's light many of societie's problems have definite cause and solution.
The Owner(s) of a particular facility may not even know that it's theirs. Still less need   they be involved with, or even know, or care, what goes on in it. Yet they hold the purse-strings. They have the power of life and death over it. They'll oil it's wheels, while they see fit. While it rolls out their profits. But only while.

In contrast, it's the <i>workers</i> that must directly manage and carry out <i>all</i> of the work. Wage-earners run society from cleaner to manager. But not ever in their own interests. We slave away always for someone else's gain. There's never enough people for the job - that's 'efficiency'. And there's never enough time. That's 'money'. There's always the threat of the 'dole' and the exclusions that lack of money then brings. The futility and waste of war, and the endless preparations for it, as the Owners squabble amongst themselves over the wealth and peace they've stolen from all mankind.

Profit is always the 'bottom-line' - <i>their</i> profit.<div class="thinnestSpace"></div>

Workers' interests are in direct opposition to the interests of the capitalists.
Strikes, lock-outs and shut-downs are the standard for 'industrial relations' as the two opposing forces clash.
Workers always have to struggle, usually in vain, to maintain or improve their wages and conditions. 
 The capitalist interest is always to depress their workers' pay as far as possible. In particular, it must always be less than the sales-value that their labour is likely to produce. The difference, the <i>un-paid</i> part of the labour of the working class, sources the <i>un-earned</i> income of the capitalists - their 'profits'.
It's waged-labour that creates the profits that keep the capitalists rich without having to work.

Everywhere, at all times, openly festering or simmering just under the surface, there is an 'Antagonism of Interests...'
