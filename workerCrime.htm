If we're lucky"</div></div>

<div class="mainw" ><div id="thinnerSpace"></div>
Crime seemed an easy way out. At least at the start. Better than being a wage-slave. I knew I couldn't take that. Working for peanuts. Doing what I was told, when I was told, how I was told. Working all hours. Or none. Working to order. No, not for me.
<div class="thinnerSpace"></div></div>

<div class="main" >
<div class="thinnerSpace"></div>
I'd be 'self-employed', if you like! That suited me more. Easy money. As and when I fancied it. Or so I thought. A one way ticket to the good life! That dream soon faded!
<div class="thinnerSpace"></div></div>

<div class="mainw" >
<div class="thinnerSpace"></div>
I just wanted a bit of everything. I could see it all flashed at me from every shop-front, every bill-board, every screen. 'You must have me'! But, even outside the 'Law', you can't evade the bills. They just don't ever stop coming. One way or another, you always have to pay. No rest for the wicked! It's so hard to make ends meet.
<div class="thinnerSpace"></div></div>

<div class="main" >
<div class="thinnerSpace"></div>
Everyone pays for everything. They've got it all taped up tight. No matter how hard you wriggle or duck and dive. And they've got the full force of the 'Law' to back them up. Doing what I do, you're always looking over your shoulder. Always running scared. 
<div class="thinnerSpace"></div></div>

<div class="thinnerSpace"></div>
Prison's a nasty place, whatever some say. And once you've been 'inside' - well you're outside : for life, really. You'll not likely be hired, even if you do try to change your tune. Faces will stare, doors slam. Or never even open. Best get out of town, try to bury your past. Start again. Always starting again...
<div class="thinnerSpace"></div></div>

<div class="main" >
<div class="thinnerSpace"></div>
Outside the 'System' - outside the Pale - I've realised the circles still the same. 'Crooked' or 'straight' you're always playing someone else's game. A game you can't ever win, at least not for long. One they can't fail to. They've got the tables stacked, they already hold  all the cards. They hold everything. They're the rich.  
<div class="thinnerSpace"></div></div>

<div class="mainw" >
<div class="thinnerSpace"></div>
And it's them who deny us the little we need, even when it's palpably there, flaunted in our faces, unless we can pay. They who steal from the poor. I'm sure that's how they got rich, in the first place. I don't know how they spin their trick. But I do know, it's the poor do the work and it's the rich who always get richer. Of course, whatever it is, it's all legal. Celebrated even. There's no Police knocking at their door.
