<div class="mainw">
State ownership is where a government Owns and runs a part, or the whole, of the economy directly.
<span class="goldie">Wages</span> are still paid to workers, and <span class="greeny">Rent</span>, <span class="bluey">Interest</span> and <span class="reddy">Profit</span> are still taken from the un-paid part of thir labour.
The working class still produces un-earned income for, and at the behest of, a privileged minority.
This goes  either to the original Owners or, as in the self-proclaimed "communist" states, those who control the party/state apparatus.
