<div class="mainw">
State ownership is where a government runs a part, or the whole, of the economy directly.<br>
<span class="goldie">Wages</span> are still paid to workers, and <span class="greeny">Rent</span>, <span class="bluey">Interest</span> and <span class="reddy">Profit</span> are still taken from their labours.<br>
The working class still produces un-earned income for, and at the behest of, a <b><i>privileged</i></b> minority.<br>
This goes  either to the original Owners or to those who control the party/state apparatus.
</div>

<div class="bottom-overline"><div class="thinnestSpace"></div>
The working class still does <u><i>not</i></u> own or control.
