It's not that we didn't work hard. When they let us work, that is. Far from it. The Bosses saw to that. We were over a barrel, really. They always got what they wanted out of us. Longer hours for less pay? More for less? Well, it was better than losing our jobs - till we lost them anyway! They said we all had to be more competitive & productive. Seemed a strange way to do it! They meant we were a burden. So many are unemployed, these days. Or working short-time, waiting on it. Those that are still working seem to be at it all hours. I've heard of some who are working three jobs! Not surprising they need child-care : that's some sort of a vicious circle, I guess. Even outside the Law, you can't evade the bills. Everyone pays for everything. They've got it all taped up tight. It's hard to make ends meet. The future's so uncertain.

Getting and keeping your Benefits is a job in itself. It seems to get harder with every new claim. And we're  claiming more often. Contracts seem to be shorter and shorter. But the claim forms get longer. The trials and tests harder to 'pass'. 'Signing' gets harder by the week. 'You can't be trying; why didn't you apply for this job? You're lying! You can't really still be ill, can you?' They make you feel so small. Guess they're over a barrel, too - you've got to do your job, haven't you! If you want to keep it! There's a lot of scroungers about!

Mind you, most jobs seem to be boring and repetitious. More and more, just feeding machines and filling forms. The work we do get never seems to interest or engage. Often enough, it doesn't even seem useful. Anything that does need doing is usually the last thing that is. Half of what is done seems to be pointless, anyway. Just swilling money around to the 'right' places, in the 'right' measures. Balancing their books. Or stopping people walking off with things, without paying! Guess it's just the daily grind. How could it be different? Sometimes we get a rise. It always takes  a fight, though!  But prices always seem to go up just as fast. If not faster. Still, we can't complain. It's all for the good of the company, I suppose. And the country. We're all in it together, after all. Aren't we?

We haven't got much more than what we need to live on from day to day. Most of that's still 'on credit'. Still, all our money's gone as soon as it comes in. Saving? - they're having a laugh, aren't they? Just keeping the roof over our heads is a constant worry. The mortgage seems to be dragging on and on. Always beats me, how a few bricks & bits of wood & slates etc., can take a life-time to pay for! They seem to keep moving the goalposts, as it were, with the payments, to suit themselves. So it's good, now, we'll all be allowed to work on. Or try to. Not just thrown on the scrapheap at 60 or 65.

Then there's the  kids' education. They'll have to go to University. They all do, now, to get ahead. Seems to me they'll all have Degrees or whatever, soon. But who'll be ahead, then? Still, we all have to strive, to get ahead. To get anywhere! But will there still be the jobs? Everywhere you hear they're cutting costs, axing this, closing that. 
<div class="thinnerSpace"></div></div>

<div class="main" >
<div class="thinnerSpace"></div>
We'll be working as long as we can, though. Or at least, hoping to! We certainly need to! On top of everything else, there's the care-costs, for the parents'. They'll have to go into a Home, soon. We're too busy working to do it ourselves. Much as we'd like to. It's not good to depend on others. Some have a house to sell, but we're at our wits' end. With all the Cuts, just who will pay? We're sure it'll all work out in the end. Things can only get better, as the 'other half' always says.

Anyway, we just crack on : what can we do about it? We're just ordinary folks. The best people are at the top, where they should be. They deserve every penny they get. If they can't make it work, who can? We always vote. After all, it's only once every few years. It's nice to have our say. But I'm not sure whether anyone listens!  Anyway it's our duty. Some say they're all the same, the parties. Sure, most-times it seems to work out that way. It's just a matter of getting the right Leaders in. The right policies. Give them credit, I say - just who can control the economy?
