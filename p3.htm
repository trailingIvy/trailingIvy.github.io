A very, very few, called collectively the 'Capitalist Class' effectively own <i>all</i> thats in and on the Earth. 
It's been said they would bottle, and then sell us back, the air itself, if they only knew how. 

So it's always someone else's factory, on someone else's land : and it's always 
someone else's goods, in someone else's shops.

<div class="bottom-line"><div class="thinnestSpace"></div>
Access to anything and everything, is by someone else rules.

All employment is skewed towards, and constrained by, the need to produce the <i>most</i> profit for the employer.
That profit increases their share of ownership, or Capital. 
The lower your wages, the longer your hours, the worse your conditions, the higher <i>their</i> profits.

All your wage is swallowed up just buying back your needs.<div class="thinnestSpace"></div>

It's not <i>just</i> greed. Like it or not, entrepeneur, company or nation are all in direct competition. There's sales-revenue and 'market-share' at stake. Maybe 'acquisitions' to be fought over. Those that don't 'grow' may be open to take-over, bankruptcy or break-up. 'Success' requires 'failure'.
All politicians are tied to working within this economic 'reality'. It's anarchy, but all well stacked-up by the Law, of course. They weren't mandated to change any of it. It's not surprising when, yet again, any rashly made 'promises' have to be quietly ditched.

The capitalist class have <i>economic</i> and <i>political</i> power.
<div class="thinnestSpace"></div>
</div>

<div class="main" >
They are indeed the <i>master</i> class.
But it's not a matter of '<i>good</i>' or '<i>evil</i>' or anything like that. It doesn't  matter how 'nice', or otherwise, capitalists are, as people. They must always be in competition, at war even, if necessary, with each other. Nor can they help but have opposite economic interests to the working class. 
This model of 'economy' can do nought but stagger on, every day frustrating the efforts of the many in the interests of the very, very few.

There's no way we can ever be 'all in it together'.<div class="thinnestSpace"></div>

Social conflict will forever follow from the minority ownership of Capital. 
Capital ownership can only be ended by a majority democratic action, on a world-scale. A co-operative majority can take back 'social wealth' and have it once again held and used in 'common'. A free for all, production only for use can replace the endless insanity of competition between classes for profit.
