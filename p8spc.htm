The <b>Socialist Party of Canada</b> is part of a global <b>World Socialist Movement</b> that believes capitalism cannot meet the needs of the <i>majority</i> of the people in the world. It does not today, and it never can. In order to meet these needs capitalism must be <i>replaced</i> by socialism.
<div class="thinnestSpace"></div></div>

<div class="bottom-line"><div class="thinnestSpace"></div>
<span class="blue">The world working-class - it's wage-slaved - must work <i>consciously</i> and <i>politically</i> for this end</span>.
<div class="thinnestSpace"></div></div>

<div class="main" >
<div class="thinnestSpace"></div>
The Socialist Party of Canada does <i>not</i> support the idea of reforming capitalism and therefore does <i>not</i> work for reforms. 
There are plenty of other organizations that do and yet the problems remain. By relegating socialism to the future, it is relegated to never.

<span class="green">Only a party dedicated <i>solely</i> to socialism can promote socialism in any real, honest manner</span>.

<div class="mainw"><div class="thinnestSpace"></div>
Among all the political parties in Canada, only the Socialist Party of Canada is dedicated to socialism as an <i>immediate</i> goal.
It is this objective that makes the Socialist Party of Canada <b>revolutionary</b> - our dedication to peaceful, democratic and <i>immediate</i> change.
The Socialist Party of Canada is, therefore, engaged in a <b><i>war</i></b> of <b><i>ideas</i></b> against <b>all</b> other parties.

<div class="main" >
<div class="thinnestSpace"></div>
Only the conscious action of the working class can end the Wages System of Capitalism and establish the CommonWealth of Socialism.
The Socialist Party of Canada works <i>only</i> to increase understanding of, and mobilize support for, this end.
