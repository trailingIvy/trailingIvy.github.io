It's not that we didn't work hard. When they actually let us work, that was. Sometimes they just couldn't get enough of us. It was more than your job was worth to turn down 'overtime'! Always soon enough, 'tho, we were down the 'dole' again. Job done, contract lost, or firm gone bust. Sure we worked hard : we had too! Every hour that was sent, it seems, now. A life-time of them. The Bosses saw to that. We were over a barrel, really. They always got what they wanted out of us. Longer hours for less pay? Give more for less? They always said we all had to be more competitive & productive. Well, it was better than losing our jobs. Till we lost them anyway! Seemed a strange way to increase productivity! They meant we were a burden. So often, so many of us were unemployed.  Or working short-time, waiting on it. Contracts always seemed to get shorter & shorter.

Getting and keeping your Benefits was a job in itself. It seemed to get harder with every new claim.Those that were still working seemed to be at it all hours.  I remember some who were working three jobs! - or more! Not surprising they needed child-care : that was some sort of a vicious circle, I guess. It was hard to make ends meet. The future was so uncertain. It still is!

Mind you, most of my jobs seemed to be boring and repetitious. Feeding machines and filling forms. The work we got never seemed to interest or engage. Half of it wwas pointless, anyway. Just swilling money around to the 'right' places, in the 'right' measures. Balancing their books. Or stopping people walking off with things, without paying! Guess it was just the daily grind. How could it be different? Sometimes we got a rise. It always took a fight, though! But prices always seemed to go up just as fast. If not faster. The Lord giveth - and the Lord taketh away! Still, we can't complain. It was all for the good of the companies, I suppose. Mind you, most of them have gone under, now! And for the country. We're all in it together, after all. Aren't we?

We still haven't got much more than what we need to live on from day to day. Much of that's still 'on credit'. Usually, all our money's gone on bills & debts as soon as it comes in. Saving? - they're having a laugh, aren't they? Just keeping the roof over our heads was a constant worry. Beats me, how a few bricks & bits of wood & slates etc., took us a life-time to pay for! The mortgage seemed to be drag on and on. They seemed to keep moving the goalposts, as it were, with the payments, to suit themselves. We seemed to spend twenty years just paying off the interest!

Funny, now I've the time to think about it, how the interest on our debts was always so high. But our Savings and Pensions just didn't ever seem to grow. In fact, some of it turned out to be money down the drain. Inflation and all that, I guess. They did warn 'pots' could rise and fall, I suppose. Stocks and Shares - we left it to the experts. But I guess the economy's just not that predictable, even to them. So it's good, now, how people are allowed to work on. Not just be thrown on the scrapheap at 60 or 65. At least, try to work on. God knows how they'll be up to it, 'tho. I know we were'nt! We were worn out!

The kids were bright. They chose University. Back then, far fewer did. They're away now, mind - there wasn't the work around here. Not since everything shut, all the old industries. Foreign competition, they said. You have to chase the work, don't you? Get on. They did visit, every once in a while, when they could get away from work. But it's been less and less as the years have gone on. It's a long way - very expensive. And they've their own lives, now. They're very busy. We miss them. There's lots of families round here been split like that. Whole communities. Whole towns have died, even. That's progress, though, I guess...

Anyway, we just crack on : what can we do about it? We're just ordinary folks. The best people are at the top, where they should be. They deserve every penny they get. If they can't make it work, who can? We always vote. After all, it's only once every few years. It's nice to have our say.  Contribute. But I'm not sure whether anyone listens! Anyway it's our duty. Some say they're all the same, the parties. Sure, most-times it seems to work out that way. It's just a matter of getting the right Leaders in. The right policies. Give them credit, I say - just who can control the economy?
