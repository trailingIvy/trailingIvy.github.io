<b>O.K!</b> So you're Working Class. Probably everyone else you know is, regardless of their income or their airs & graces. 95% of us are Working Class - an ever-growing fraction. You've had to work hard for everything you've got - and you haven't got much. You're  always having to fight to keep it. But it can still be snatched away in the blink of an eye. Permanently insecure. Permanently chasing 'jam' tomorrow. Permanently feeling frustrated by a 'lack of money' & pushed around by the 'powers that be' & 'market forces'.

<div class="thinnerSpace"></div>
But it's <b>NOT</b> O.K! The <b>WORKING CLASS</b> condition is <b>NOT</b> O.K!<br>We are in CHAINS! Chains we must recognise before we can break them.

There is only <b>one</b> other Class. The <b>CAPITALIST</b> CLASS. They are the <b>MASTER</b> CLASS!<br>There's barely a field or street of this earth that they don't <b>Own</b>.<br>Everywhere it's <b>KEEP OUT! KEEP OFF!</b><br>
Of course, it's all 'legal'. They've enshrined their THEFT in LAW. Years and years ago.<br>So long ago we've all forgotten all about it, it's all taken for granted.

They have the property rights. They pay for the State to back them up.<br><b>TRESPASSERS WILL BE PROSECUTED!</b><br>We just do the Work. If & when they let us. There is no other (legal) choice.<br>On <b><i>their</i></b> land. Down <b><i>their</i></b> mines. In <b><i>their</i></b> factories. Making <b><i>their</i></b> things.<br>For Sale,  only at <b><i>their</i></b> Profit.<br><b>THIEVES WILL BE PROSECUTED!</b>
<div class="thinnerSpace"></div></div>

You can't get anything without <b><u>Money</u></b>. You can't get money legally except through a <b><u>JOB</u></b>. You can't get a job except at their invite. Jobs aren't just there for our benefit - the Employers need to see the prospect or actuality of a Profit. So we only work under their terms. For their <b><u>Profits</u></b>. Or not at all.

If you don't work you can't pay, you don't get. If you don't get you can't live...<br><b>WAGES, PRICES, RENT, INTEREST and PROFIT</b><br>These are the <b>CHAINS</b> that bind you, me - almost everyone. Unnecessary chains.<br><div class="dottedline">--------------------------</div>
<b>WAGE-SLAVERY!</b> That's <i>their</i> <b>RULE</b> : what's yours?
