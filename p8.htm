The <b>Socialist Party of Great Britain</b> is part of a global <b>World Socialist Movement</b> that believes capitalism cannot meet the needs of the <i>majority</i> of the people in the world. It does not today, and it never can. In order to meet these needs capitalism must be <i>replaced</i> by socialism.

<span class="blue">The world working-class - it's wage-slaved - must work <i>consciously</i> and <i>politically</i> for this end</span>.

The Socialist Party of Great Britain does <i>not</i> support the idea of reforming capitalism and therefore does <i>not</i> work for reforms. 
There are plenty of other organizations that do and yet the problems remain. By relegating socialism to the future, it is relegated to never.

Among all the political parties in Great Britain, only the Socialist Party is dedicated to socialism as an <i>immediate</i> goal.
It is this objective that makes the Socialist Party <b>revolutionary</b> - our dedication to peaceful, democratic and <i>immediate</i> change.
The Socialist Party is, therefore, engaged in a <b><i>war</i></b> of <b><i>ideas</i></b> against <b>all</b> other parties.

<div class="thinnestSpace"></div>
Only the conscious action of the working class can end the Wages System of Capitalism and establish the CommonWealth of Socialism.
The Socialist Party works <i>only</i> to increase understanding of, and mobilize support for, this end.
