<div class="mainw">
Different regions may often pride themselves on having their own particular and distinct customs. <br>
However, the modern world has effectively become a "global village".<br>
Each region actually operates within a greater <b><i>system of society</i></b> that is world-wide.
</div>

<div class="main">This system of society is called <b>Capitalism</b>.<br>
Capitalism is recognised everywhere by the existence of <b>Wages</b> and <b>Prices</b>.
<div class="dotted-line">---------------------------</div>
The alternative, <b>Socialism</b>, won't use <b>Money</b>. <br>
Socialism will be based upon <b>Voluntary Labour</b> with <b>Free Access</b> to goods & services for <b>All</b>.</div>
  
<div class="mainw">
Production will be arranged <b><i>directly</i></b> in line with <b>needs</b>, and controlled <b><i>democratically</i></b> by and in the interest of the whole community.
