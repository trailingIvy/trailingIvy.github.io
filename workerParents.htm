It's not that they don't work hard. When they're allowed to work, that is. Far from it. The Bosses see to that. They're over a barrel, really. They always get what they want out of them. Longer hours for less pay? More for less? Well, it's better than losing their job, isn't it. They've got responsibilities - me(!) and bills to pay. But usually they lose them anyway! They said they all had to be more competitive & productive. Seemed a strange way to do it! They meant they were a burden. So many are unemployed, these days. Or working short-time, waiting on it. Those that are still working seem to be at it all hours. I've heard of some who are working three jobs! Not surprising they need child-care : that's some sort of a vicious circle, I guess. Even outside the Law, you can't evade the bills. Everyone pays for everything. They've got it all taped up tight. It's hard to make ends meet. The future's so uncertain.

Getting and keeping their Benefits increasingly seems to be a job in itself. They say it's harder every time they claim. And they're  having to claim more often. Contracts seem to be shorter and shorter. But the claim forms get longer. The trials and tests harder to 'pass'. 'Signing' gets harder by the week. 'You can't be trying; why didn't you apply for this job? You're lying! You can't really still be ill, can you?' They say they make you feel so small. Guess they're over a barrel, too - you've got to do your job, haven't you! If you want to keep it! There's a lot of scroungers about!
<div class="thinnerSpace"></div></div>

Mind you, mostly their jobs seem to be boring and repetitious. More and more, just feeding machines and filling forms. Their work never seems to interest or engage. Often enough, it doesn't even seem useful. Anything that does need doing is usually the last thing that is. That's what Mam says. Dad says half of what is done is pointless, anyway. Just swilling money around to the 'right' places, in the 'right' measures. Balancing their books. Or stopping people walking off with things, without paying! Guess it's just the daily grind. How could it be different? Sometimes they get a rise. It always takes  a fight, though! But prices always seem to go up just as fast. If not faster. Still, we can't complain. It's all for the good of the company, I suppose. And the country. We're all in it together, after all. Aren't we?
<div class="thinnerSpace"></div></div>

<div class="thinnerSpace"></div>
We don't seem to have much more than what we need to live on from day to day. Most of that's still 'on credit'. Still, all their money's gone as soon as it comes in. Saving? - they're having a laugh, aren't they? I need a car. But Dad says they can barely keep their one on the road. Just keeping the roof over our heads is their constant worry.  Always beats me, how a few bricks & bits of wood & slates etc., can take a life-time to pay for! Their mortgage seems to be dragging on and on. They seem to keep having the goalposts moved, as it were, with the payments, running just to stand still. So it's good, now, they'll all be allowed to work on. Or try to. Not just be thrown on the scrapheap at 60 or 65.

Mam always said I was bright. When I was young I knew I wanted to go away to University and learn about the World. So I could help people. Dad always said I had my head in the clouds : we'd not likely be able to afford that. Mam said it wasn't a girl's place! I'm not so sure, now. I'd like to get a job, here, earn some money, have some fun. Maybe meet a bloke. But there's not the jobs, now, since the mills all shut, and the Yard. And all the guys have gone, contracting, away.
<div class="thinnerSpace"></div></div>

<div class="thinnerSpace"></div>
And they've changed their tune, too. Nothing for me here, they say. Get away, make something of yourself. Mam says she'll miss me, but I guess College it is. Even 'tho I don't fancy the debt. If I'm anything like my parents I'll never get out of it again. Everyone's going to College, now. 'Cause there's not the jobs. But I'm not sure I can see it any better on the other side. If we've all got Degrees, how will that help? Degrees don't make jobs. It's Employers do that. When my Dad studied, he was an apprentice, he already had a job!

Anyway, I'll just crack on : what can I do about it all? I'm just an ordinary girl. The best people are at the top, where they should be. Even if there's not enough of us girls. They deserve every penny they get. If they can't make it work, who can? I'll always vote. After all, it's only once every few years. I like to have my say! Contribute. But I'm not sure whether anyone listens! Some say they're all the same, the parties. Sure, most-times it seems to work out that way. It's just a matter of getting the right Leaders in. The right policies. Give them credit, I say - just who can control the economy?
