History shows how the Conservative and (now re-named) Liberal Parties came into being to gain representation in Parliament for two sets of conflicting interests. These were, respectively, those of the already long-existing land-owning and priest Classes and those of the just-developing industrial Capitalists. Today we're still familiar with the way certain individuals or groups attach themselves to ('back', often with cash) various political parties.

Political parties of the left, right and centre, always <i>claim</i> to be working for the betterment of society as a whole. However, taking power without any mandate to remove Capitalism, they are as ever forced to work <i>within</i> it's constraints. 
Their hands are tied first and foremost to the over-riding needs of the Owning Classes. They must maintain and maximise the flow of Rent, Interest and Profit into the capitalist's hands.<div class="thinnestSpace"></div> </div>

All the parties make much of having their own new and unique approach to their time in Parliamentary 'Office'. Each claims to be alone in having the right plan for 'prosperity for all'. Yet it's a matter of common-knowledge that 'they're all the same' once in 'power'. 
Any 'prosperity' is won, as usual, by hard work, and is, as usual, short-lived. Much heralded or needed reforms are often weakened, or dropped altogether. None of the parties have or can have any really new ideas. Everything has already been tried and found to fail in the past

It's because the 'economic reality' of a society configured in the interests of a minority, exploiting class, is left calling the tune, whatever the government.
Capitalism is <i>designed</i> to work for the minority. It works by taking <b>un-earned income</b> for the few from the <b>un-paid labour</b> of the many.
Capitalism means an endless, unavoidable chaos of competition. It's  workers against workers, workers against owners and owners, as individuals, companies or nations, againsts owners. It's a world of 'boom' then 'bust' then....It's permanent instability,  in-security and worry.

The Socialist Party is hostile to the <i>lack of ideas</i> of those who support capitalism outright or claim they can make it work for the many.
The Socialist Party is <i>unique</i> in saying that the working has <i>no</i> interests in common with the exploiting class.
The Socialist Party alone says that the working class can and should act <i>for and by itself</i> to re-cast society in it's <i>own</i> interests.
That to so do it must abolish private and state Capital, and institute a world <b>CommonWealth</b> under <b>Democratic</b> control.
That this must mean the abolition of money in favour of <i>voluntary</i> labour and <i>free</i> access.
