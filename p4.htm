There is a tendency to regard human society as being fixed and unchanging. Most seem to think that things are not only as they always have been, but as they only ever could be. Perhaps this isn't surprising. After all, any one life is short in relation to all of human history. It's true, after all, that no <i>fundamental</i> change has occurred in 'living memory'.
<div class="thinnestSpace"></div>
</div>
<div class="bottom-line"><div class="thinnestSpace"></div>
However, it's clear from history that societies have evolved.
<div class="thinnestSpace"></div></div>

<div class="main" >
<div class="thinnestSpace"></div>
Societies evolve, just like all natural systems. In fact, so far, greatly differing societies called, in order of appearance, 'primitive communist', 'Slave', Feudal', and 'Capitalist', have all existed.
The accumulation of the first surpluses began the end of the free association of individuals that had been 'primitive communism'. Each society since has been based on the <i>ownership</i> and control of these surpluses by <i>sections</i> only - 'Classes' - of the population.
<div class="thinnestSpace"></div>
</div>
<div class="bottom-line" ><div class="thinnestSpace"></div>
Societies have been divided into 'haves' and 'have-nots'.
<div class="thinnestSpace"></div>
</div>

<div class="mainw" >
<div class="thinnestSpace"></div>
Those with control have always used it to secure their own privilege, usually at the expense of the members of the other classes. 
Every society since 'primitive communism' has rested on the 'legalised' exploitation of one or more classes by one or more other classes. 
Today, for example, we have those few who own the '<a href="p4.htm" onClick="window.open('means.htm', 'means', config= 'toolbar=0,menubar=0,scrollbars=0,height=196,width=880,top=147,left=200')">means of production</a>' living on the backs of (and frequently squashing) the wage-dependant majority. Capitalism - production only for sale at a profit - has itself only relatively recently replaced Feudalism. Under Feudalism, most were tied to and worked the landowners' fields, giving up a portion of their produce for the privilege.
<div class="thinnestSpace"></div>
</div>
<div class="bottom-line"><div class="thinnestSpace"></div>
Landowners and priests once lorded it over the 'peasants'.
<div class="thinnestSpace"></div>
</div>

<div class="main" >
<div class="thinnestSpace"></div>
Each society listed above represents a change, a 'revolution' - in the property relationships underlying the economic activities of the time. But change doesn't just happen by itself. Not only do the material conditions have to be right, but  a class has to see it's interest, and seize it by the best available means. Today's dominant capitalist class did just that when usurping the once exclusive, hereditary, powers of the aristocratic landowning and priest classes. 

<div class="thinnestSpace"></div>
</div>
<div class="bottom-line"><div class="thinnestSpace"></div>
Isn't further change desirable and possible, now?
<div class="thinnestSpace"></div>
</div>

<div class="mainw" >
<div class="thinnestSpace"></div>
The working class has more to gain from change than the capitalists. It's our class that will labour night and day for their profits - possibly forever - if we don't change things. That will 'trade in our hours for a handful of dimes' - all the rest of our lives. Our members that will die in their wars.  That will never own  much more than our ability to work, and get there, and maybe a place to rest when we return. That will live and die by the rule 'can't pay - can't have'. Because production is only ever for sale at a profit. Capital's profit.
<div class="thinnestSpace"></div>
</div>
<div class="bottom-line"><div class="thinnestSpace"></div>
At least, while we continue to allow it.
<div class="thinnestSpace"></div>
</div>

<div class="main" >
<div class="thinnestSpace"></div>
For it is in <i>our</i> power, ours alone, to make the change. We are, after all, the vast majority. We already manage society from 'top' to 'bottom'. Above all, we have won, through science and technology, the capability for abundance : for sufficient production to meet the needs of all, all of the time.
When the majority of wage-earners finally act for themselves, and dis-possesses the minority of Owners, society will become Class-less. Two competing Classes will have become one, unified whole.
<div class="thinnestSpace"></div>

Social evolution will have reached the end of the road.

Societies '<a href="p4.htm"  title="please click for more..." onClick="window.open('means.htm', 'means', config= 'toolbar=0,menubar=0,scrollbars=0,height=196,width=880,top=147,left=200')">means of living</a> -  can become held in <i>common</i>, as they once were. The superfluous, expensive, ridiculous and disgusting paraphernalia of <b>Prices</b> and <b>Wages</b>, and <b>Rent</b>, <b>Interest</b> and <b>Profit</b> can be finally disposed of. Production will be freed up to the meeting of needs, and needs alone. Money will no longer be needed as a means to siphon un-earned income into the hands of privileged minorities. Money will no longer be used to exclude from, and arbitrate over, social access. People will determine their own consumption, in line with availability. Social decisions, including those of production, as necessary, will be arrived at by democratic means. No one voice, or group of voices will over-ride, nor will any be excluded.
The conflicts arising daily from the false division of <b>Capital</b> and <b>Labour</b> will disappear.

The hate and distrust that exists in society today is a direct result of the nature of societies past and present.
Capitalism is a society in which we must compete to survive, in which our jobs appear threatened by other workers, in which we are <i>never</i> secure.
It's a fertile breeding ground for racism, sexism, nationalism and all the other hatreds that typically abound.
Yet, even today, the prejudices that can pit one worker against another are increasingly being rooted out and made socially unacceptable.
In South Africa, for example, there is a shortage of white workers.
Black workers are filling previously "white-only" workplaces without the major disruption that would once have been caused by overt racism.

Far more unites the human race than ever appears to divide it.
<div class="thinnestSpace"></div>

<div class="mainw" >
<div class="thinnestSpace"></div>
No society can meet our human needs as long as it treats people as being of different classes. 
Every person has abilities that differentiate them from others, but we are all equal in our humanity. We all have strengths and weaknesses.
What we need is a society that allows us to use our strengths, and that accepts and accommodates our weaknesses.

Socialism will be a society geared to meeting human needs, and the need to be accepted for what we are is probably the most basic of human needs.
With the breeding ground for hatred gone, people will naturally be able to live without it.
