In fact, I was doing alright. Or so I thought. Steady job, in line for promotion, even. Not the greatest of shakes, but you stick in there, don't you? For the wife, the kids. If not, necessarily, for yourself. It' not always about just having fun, a good time, is it?

But then the 'parent' company went bust. The downturn, they said - not their fault. How will you sell wheel-chairs, in a recession? Their expensive, after all, there'll not be the 'demand'. Anyway, we lost our funding. The investors took their money out. And I lost my job. It might still have been o.k., if it wasn't for the debt. Beyond the usual stuff - car, mortgage - I owed a bit from gambling. I'd developed quite a habit, without really realising it. Or the size of the debt! It had been my escape from the humdrum, every flutter a dream of 'better things'. My bit of fun. But debt's a nightmare, when you lose your income.

The wife was off - and she took the kids. The Bank took the house - 're-possesion'. Then it was the drink, for me, amongst other things. Which, of course, I couldn't really afford. Soon enough, I had to 'get out of town'. Anyway, that's how I ended up here. On the street...

The food-banks are a boon. Surprising how they've sprung up everywhere. Timely, you might say. Seems like you don't have to be homeless to need their services...And there's always the skips, outside the supermarkets, cafe's etc. But you've got to be careful, there. If you can get in, that is, past the gates & barbed-wire. They might have 'thrown' it, but they still don't seem that keen on people like me just helping themselves.

There's hostels, of course, for the nights. At some places, anyway. They're not usually keen on you staying too long, though. There's always others coming along, you see, in the same boat. They can't be expected to keep everyone. But you get warm, a bit more sorted out, for a while.
<div class="thinnerSpace"></div></div>

<div class="main" >
<div class="thinnerSpace"></div>
It's the nights that are the worst. Sometimes you've the company of others, sometimes not. There's doorways, the parks, under bridges, derelict land. But wherever you are, it's best not to be seen. If it's the police, they'll move you on. If it's security, they'll call the police. Doesn't really seem to matter how derelict or un-used it is : it always seems to be somebodies. Sometimes a cell's welcome, mind.

Begging's a bit of a come-down, I've got to say. It's not easy, that. Showing your face when you're like this, showing your weakness, your need. Some people are ok, some just pass you by, eyes un-seeing, or pretending to. Everyone's a bit short, with the money, these days, I guess. Everyone's got their own problems. Others 'tho, will laugh at you. Or worse. Mainly the young. Maybe they don't know just how hard it can get. At least, not yet....

Seems to me we're set up to fail, somehow. Life - or something, anyway, is always knocking, knocking, chipping away. We all start strong. With the best intentions. I even had goals, once. But most weaken. Some fall, like me. I blamed myself, for a long time. The wife certainly did. But I'm not so sure, now. As I wander around, I see everything I need's all around me. I just can't reach it. I've just not got the key, that's all. Money.

Without it, the doors always locked. They keep it that way. Everything's behind bars, counters, in showrooms, behind price-tags. They says there's not enough to go round, that's why. But that's not what I see, as I wander around. I think it's some sort of vicious circle. There's always plenty, for those with the money. But just who's going to make things for those who can't pay? Nobody's that stupid. So who has got the money? Them that always did have it, that's my guess.
