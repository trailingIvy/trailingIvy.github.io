Hundreds of years ago, my <b>Class</b> fought the previously ruling absolute <b>Aristocracy</b> to remove their domination in favour of a  <b>Political Democracy</b> which would pass Laws to represent our interests as <b>LandLords</b>, <b>Investors</b> and <b>Employers</b>. This <b>Law</b> still, today, enshrines our advantages by allowing us to <b>Capitalise</b> on our <b>Property</b> to yield <b>Un-Earned Income</b> for ourselves. 
<div class="thinnerSpace"></div></div>

<div class="main" >
<div class="thinnerSpace"></div>
My <b>Class</b> today <b>Owns</b> virtually all the <b>Means</b> of <b>Production</b> & <b>Distribution</b>. That's the land, factories, railways.., etc. People only <b>work</b> or <b>consume</b> on our terms : we have to <b>Profit</b> from it. Profit is sourced from the <b>Un-paid Labour</b> of the <b>Wage-Earners</b> or <b>Working Class</b> whose <b>Labour</b> alone produces all <b>Value</b>. <b>Employers</b> take some of their profit as income, some is re-invested, and the rest is split with the <b>LandLords</b> and <b>Investors</b> as <b>Rent</b> & <b>Interest</b>. Regardless of the degree of social needs left un-met, our Rules are '<b>No Profit - No Production</b>' & '<b>Can't Pay? Go Away</b>! Collectively we live, generally very well, off our <b>Un-Earned Income</b>. A few of us work, but none of us have to. 
<div class="thinnerSpace"></div></div>

<div class="mainw" >
<div class="thinnerSpace"></div>
Our <b>Ownership</b>, <b>Wealth</b>, & <b>Power</b> as a <b>Class</b> is ever-growing, both in absolute terms, & relative to that of the general population. We fund, control and use the <b>State</b> machinery as necessary, even to the extent of <b>War</b>, to maintain, defend and mediate our interests. 
<div class="thinnerSpace"></div></div>

<div class="main" >
<div class="thinnerSpace"></div>
We <b>Possess</b>, but do <b><u>not</u> Produce</b> : the rest of the population, left by our <b>Ownership</b> possessing nothing but their ability to work, <b>Produce</b>, but do <b><u>not</u> Possess</b>. They, the <b>Working Class</b>, do everything in <b>Society</b>, except to run it in their own interests, to their own advantage.
<div class="thinnerSpace"></div></div>

<div class="mainw" >
<div class="thinnerSpace"></div>
They, the workers, thankfully remain ignorant of their <b>Power</b>, as the producers of all <b>Value</b>, to transform social relations in their own interest, by abolishing the mechanism of their exploitation, the <b>Wages System</b>. They helpfully return all political power to my Class at every election, unaware that we are now a social anachronism : a parasite living on their backs, weighing them down, yet so easily & fruitfully shaken off...</div>
