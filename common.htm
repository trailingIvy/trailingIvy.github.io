<div class="mainw">
This means that society as a <b><i>whole </i></b>will own the <a href="common.htm" onClick="window.open('means.htm','means',  'toolbar=0,menubar=0,scrollbars=0,height=218,width=770,top=420,left=420')">means and instruments</a> of production and distribution. <br>There will be none of today's divisions between Companies and Nations competing for Profit.<br>Everyone will own the world's resources : alternatively, no-one will.</div>

<div class="main">It also implies these means will be under the democratic control of the whole community. <br>
Everyone will be empowered <i>equally</i> in the rights - and responsibilities - of this control.</div>

<div class="mainw">
Common ownership will mean <span class="goldie">Wages</span> and other <span class="bluey">Prices</span> will no longer need to exist.<br>
People will take from the common-store according to their self-determined needs.<br>They will contribute labour and time voluntarily.
<div class="dotted-line">-------------------</div>
<span class="greeny">Money</span> will <b><i>not</i></b> be used or needed.</div>

<div class="main">Common ownership is clearly<b><i> not </i></b>the same as <a href="common.htm" onClick="window.open('state.htm', 'state',  'toolbar=0,menubar=0,scrollbars=0,height=185,width=860,top=290,left=420')">state ownership</a> or 'Nationalisation' as it is often called. <br>Governments often take some, or even all, the Nation's industry under their own direct control.<br>It still produces only for sale (hopefully at a profit) and still pays it's workers in wages.
<div class="dotted-line">-------------------</div>
Nationalisation changes nothing. </div>
